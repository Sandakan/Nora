[^1]: The song lyrics use the [SongLyrics](https://www.npmjs.com/package/songlyrics) package and an implementation from the [MxLRC](https://github.com/fashni/MxLRC) package under the hood.
[^2]: Personalized shuffles and playlists are generated by analyzing the user's listening patterns and the number of times each song gets played.
[^3]: Currently, the app only supports editing mp3 files due to some limitations of the dependencies.
